## About

This project focuses on predicting customer churn prediction. Customer churn is a critical business metric, and predicting which customers are likely to churn can help businesses take proactive measures to retain them. In this project, we develop and deploy a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical customer data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- 
### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `customer_churn_prediction.ipynb` to explore the data, build and train the model.
2. To deploy the model as a web application, navigate to the `deployment` directory and follow the README instructions there.

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains customer information, including features like contract length, monthly charges, and customer demographics. The target variable is whether the customer churned or not.

## Modeling

We use various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting, to build predictive models. The best-performing model is selected for deployment.

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are also provided for a comprehensive evaluation.

## Results

Our final deployed model achieves an accuracy of 55% on the test data. This model is now ready for real-time predictions, enabling the business to identify customers at risk of churning and take appropriate actions to retain them.
